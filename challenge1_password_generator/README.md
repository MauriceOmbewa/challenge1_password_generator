This code defines a function `generate_password()` that generates a random password of a specified length. The function takes an optional argument `length` that defaults to 8 if not provided. It first creates four variables `uppercase_letters`, `lowercase_letters`, `digits`, and `symbols` that contain all uppercase letters, lowercase letters, digits, and symbols respectively.

The function then checks if the length of the password is less than 8, and if so, sets the length to 8. It initializes the password by randomly choosing one character from each of the four categories (uppercase letters, lowercase letters, digits, and symbols) and stores them in a list. It then fills the remaining characters of the password by randomly selecting characters from all categories using a loop. Finally, it shuffles the password characters in random order and returns the password as a string.

The code generates a password by calling the `generate_password()` function and prints it to the console.
