The Python code imports two modules, "random" and "time", which are necessary for generating random numbers and measuring the execution time, respectively.

The code defines a function called "quicksort" that implements the quicksort algorithm to sort an array of numbers. The function uses recursion to split the input array into three sub-arrays based on a pivot element, and then sorts the left and right sub-arrays and combines them with the middle array.

The code generates an array of random integers and calls the "quicksort" function to sort the array. It also measures the execution time of the function using the "time" module. Finally, it prints the original array, the sorted array, and the execution time.
